# Exercise 1: Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) Calculator

A simple C++ program that calculates the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of two integers using the Euclidean algorithm (subtraction version).

## 📝 Description

This program asks the user to input two integers and computes their greatest common divisor using an iterative subtraction method (a variation of the Euclidean algorithm). The result is then displayed on the screen.

## 🧮 Algorithm

The program uses the subtraction-based Euclidean algorithm:
1. Takes two integers as input
2. Repeatedly subtracts the smaller number from the larger number
3. Continues until both numbers become equal
4. The resulting equal value is the GCD
