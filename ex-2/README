# Exercise 2: Average Calculator

A simple C++ program that calculates the arithmetic mean (average) of a set of numbers entered by the user.

## 📝 Description

This program asks the user how many numbers they want to average, then prompts them to enter each value. After all numbers are entered, it calculates and displays the arithmetic mean. The program also handles the special case when the user enters zero numbers, displaying an appropriate message.

## 🧮 Algorithm

The program uses the standard arithmetic mean formula:

1. **Input validation**: Check if the number of values (n) is zero
2. **If n = 0**: Display "Average not defined" message
3. **If n > 0**: 
   - Initialize sum to 0
   - Use a loop to read n numbers from the user
   - Add each number to the running sum
   - Calculate average by dividing the total sum by n
   - Display the result
